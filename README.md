# Bend Sensor Breakout Board for String Instruments

Breakout board Kicad design files for guitar string bend sensors based on [NVE AAT001](https://www.nve.com/angleSensors) Tunnel Magnetoresistive angle sensing technology

The board integrates an AAT001 sensor and an amplifier for both _sine_ and _cosine_ componets and is supposed to be used in conjunction with N42 neodymium magnets. Design files for laser cutting a magnet holder for 3x4mm magnets and an electric guitar with string spacing of 52mm have been included.
