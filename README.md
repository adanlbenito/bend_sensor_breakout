# Bend Sensor Breakout Board for String Instruments

Breakout board Kicad design files for guitar string bend sensors based on [NVE AAT001](https://www.nve.com/angleSensors) Tunnel Magnetoresistive angle sensing technology

The board integrates an AAT001 sensor and an amplifier for both _sine_ and _cosine_ componets and is supposed to be used in conjunction with [N42 neodymium magnets](https://www.first4magnets.com/circular-disc-rod-c34/4mm-dia-x-3mm-thick-n42-neodymium-magnet-0-54kg-pull-p3049#ps_0_3096|ps_1_16682). Design files for laser cutting a magnet holder for 3x4mm magnets and an electric guitar with string spacing of 52mm have been included.
